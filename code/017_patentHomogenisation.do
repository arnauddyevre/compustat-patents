Here, we homogenise the names given to firms associated with patents. The general aims that guide this are:
- Cleaning firm names, such that, for example "GOOGLE CORP" and "GOOGLE CORPORATION" are given the same firm name.
- Homogenising patent names across the Fleming, Greene, Li, Marx and Yao (2019) data (used for the 1926-1975 period) and the PatentsView data (used for the 1976-2021 period).
- Homogenising patent names within our collated data, such that the attribution of a patent is to the ultimate owners, in the spirit of Arora, Belenzon, and Sheer (2020).

As of the 27th of June 2023, it takes approximately 4 hours and 26 minutes to run in Stata 17 on a computer with 16GB of RAM running an Intel Core i7-1165G7 processor (with 4 CPUs into 8 logical processors and an Intel Iris Xe GPU).

This script is broken down into the following sections:
017a. Name Cleaning - we simply run all firm names from both the FGLMY and PatentsView data through our centralised name cleaning algorithm, which can be found under 500_nameCleaning.do.
017b. FGLMY Re-parsing - we re-parse several of the observations in FGLMY which include a full sentence under the associated firm name.
017c. FGLMY-to-PatentsView Automated Mapping - we map clean names as they appear in FGLMY to clean names associated with the same patents (from the common 1976-2021 period) in PatentsView.
017d. Substring Match - following homogenisation of firm names across the FGLMY and PatentsView data, we take all clean names associated with 50 or more patents and find those which are substrings of each other.
017e. Further Manual Cleaning - following the substring match, we look into the top 250 patenters
017f. Creating a Full Clean Patent Dataset - following further manual cleaning, we construct a long-form patent dataset with associated original and clean names, in addition to indicator variables concenrning the generation of the clean name.
