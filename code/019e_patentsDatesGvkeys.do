This script essentially serves as some intermediary housekeeping for the upcoming scripts; it...
- Appends dates to the homogenised patent data created in 017f_fullData_patentHomogenisation.do
- Cleans the names from the dynamic name dataset created in 019a_dynamicNames.do
- Produces a dataset of *only* clean names that map to the homogenised patent data


Infiles:
- patent.dta (PatentsView's largest patent dataset, most pertinently containing the patent's publication number and the publication date.)
- application.dta (PatentsView's data on patent applications, including application date)
- uspto.govt.reliance.metadata.dta (Patent data from Fleming, Greene, Li, Marx and Yao (2019), 1926-2017)
- 014_FGLMY2675appYears.dta (USPTO patents from 1926-1975 with their application dates, as inferred from the Fleming, Greene, Li, Marx and Yao (2019) OCR.)
- 017f_patents_homogenised.dta (Observations are patents along with their associated original name, associated clean name, data source indicator, and indicators for the methods used to alter the associated clean name.)
- 019a_dynamicNames.dta (A dynamic mapping of names to gvkeys, derived from Compustat and the CRSP Daily Stock File)


Outfiles:
- 019e_patentsHomogenised_wDates.dta (Observations are patents along with grant and (where applicable) application date, their associated original name, associated clean name, data source indicator, and indicators for the methods used to alter the associated clean name.)
- 019e_dynamicNamesClean.dta (A dynamic mapping of names, as cleaned by the DyÃ¨vre-Seager algorithm, to gvkeys)
- 019e_dynamicNamesClean_matched.dta (A dynamic mapping of clean names [that also feature in our patent dataset] to gvkeys)


Called .do Files:
- 500_nameCleaning.do (The centralised name cleaning algorithm)


External Packages:
None
