# compustat-patents

This repository contains two datasets mapping publicly listed firms from Compustat to patents from the U.S. PAtents and Trademark Office, from 1950 to 2020. It is organised as follows:
- [code]: contains the Stata code used to generate the final panels of firms matched to patents. The code takes as inputs datasets described in [orig] and saves outputs in [data]
- [data]: contains two datsets, in .csv format. "static.csv" and "dynamic.csv" (need to describe them more)
- [orig]: contains *descriptions* of the raw datasets used by scripts in "code" to create the final datasets in [data]
