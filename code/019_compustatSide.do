This script processes everything on the accounting-side of the data (i.e. Compustat) that is needed for the patent-firm match.

As of the 26th of June 2023, it takes approximately 15 minutes to run in Stata 17 on a computer with 16GB of RAM running an Intel Core i7-1165G7 processor (with 4 CPUs into 8 logical processors and an Intel Iris Xe GPU).

This script is broken down into the following sections:
019a. CRSP/Compustat Dynamic Names - this script obtains all names associated with a gvkey; both the 2020 or time-of-exit name given in Compustat, and previous trading names as listed in the CRSP Daily Stock File.
019b. Listed-Listed M&A - this script identifies M&A activity from crosswalks between firm identifiers in Compustat and another set of firm identifiers; we look into M&A where one identifier remains constant and the other changes.
019c. SDC Platinum M&A - this script identifies M&A activity pertinent to our data from SDC Platinum's vast database on M&A activity.
019d. Mapping gvkeys to Ultimate Owner gvkeys - This script uses the data collected on ownership to map gvkeys to their *ultimate owner* gvkeys.
019e. Intermediary Housekeeping - This script attaches application/grant dates to the homogenised patent data, runs dynamic names through our name-cleaning algorithm, and gets a dataset of clean names that feature in both patent and accounting data.
019f. Mapping Public Firm Names to Ultimate Owner gvkeys - This script maps the names associated with each gvkey to their ultimate owner gvkeys.
019g. Mapping Private Firm Names to Ultimate Owner gvkeys - This script maps the names associated with privately held subsidiaries to their ultimate owner gvkeys.
